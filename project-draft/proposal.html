            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>
                The problem we chose to address is the overflow of information surrounding restaurants and food places around the 
                University of Washington area. This causes many students, nearby residents, and tourists to have a difficult time 
                finding a place to eat out. Additionally, students may have additional criteria when eating out such as budget, 
                location/distance, party size, and more. While there are existing solutions such as <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>, 
                they aren’t tailored to the University of Washington population or residents. For example, when finding food specifically on 
                ‘the Ave’, looking up food/restaurants recommendations online shows results on Reddit 
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/8zr2bf/whats_the_best_food_on_the_ave/">(such as this post)</a> 
                where students, alumni, and residents are the ones recommending restaurants. While good at giving information from first-hand users, 
                the overall experience of having a forum platform be the source of recommendations for food isn’t the best. Having a dedicated 
                restaurant finder will immensely make this process easier alongside making the overall user experience better.
                The users that we intend to target are both UW students, nearby residents, as well as tourists visiting the UW,
                but anyone around the area can benefit from our proposed application.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>
                Our project will focus on data organization as we are planning on taking resturants around the University
                of Washington campus and by putting them in categories from their reviews, cost, type of food, and hours of business.
                We will then visualize that data which will be useful in making decisions such as cost to reviews ratio.
                Another feature we will add that builds upon the categorizing of the restaurants would be a search feature that
                allows users to search for the restaurants by both name as well as the categories that are given to the
                restaurants. Finally, a last feature we plan to add is to allow for users to compare two restaurants to another
                so that they may compare their visualizations and statistics. To make our application possible, we will
                be pulling data from the dataset called <cite>"Seattle Area Restaurants" by
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oklena/seattle-area-restaurants?resource=download">Kaggle</a></cite>.
                This information was collected from Yelp, as they mention on their website.
